            I wish whole heartedly to this amazing person whose knows how to
            live the life to the fullest and can bring smile to everyone around

            ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤© "....you say that your friends doubt when you tell about me
            that if I perform well then why do I talk to you so long ðŸ¤”... Now
            how do I tell them that it is after talking to you only ... I get so
            motivated that I do things that I myself (formerly) had felt
            impossible to do ....."
          </p>
          <p>
            "I never felt special for anyone but you were different ....... now
            you say to feel that for others as well but sadly that's not
            possible .........you say that people around you say the same, but
            why to blame them .... yes, you are very special.......... but at
            the same time I always want you to grow and I get excited when you
            tell about your achievements .......... that's why.... thinking that
            I may not disturb you, I don't message or call you frequently ".
          </p>
          <p>
            "Now you might wonder why do I repetedly call you "special" ....
            because unlike others you are very sincere, unlike others you are
            not jealous of other's success but you support them, (I still
            remember the day in school I was extremely depressed ðŸ¥²....it was
            you who took me aside and comforted me ).
          </p>
          <p>
            You are hardworking, you are keenly interested in helping others,
            even when those people are not at all interested in helping you back
            in times of need(this is what I've noticed innumerable times in
            School). Being a head-boy, I had a wonderful opportunity to work
            with you. I never told you but many a times I've got this
            opportunity to wonder how can a person be amazing without even
            trying to be .... !! ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜€
          </p>
          <p>
            You are respectful, you don't hesitate to say sorry first when it's
            your fault i.e. you are not egoist but yes at the same time (this is
            the best quality of yours for which I admire you a lot) .....(unlike
            others) you have a lot of self-respect, you are a free bird, you
            don't hesitate putting up your opinions .
          </p>
          <p>
            Also while talking, you don't sugarcoat. You actually give me
            crtiques and that I like because I want to become better .....like
            this webpage still can have a lots and lots of improvements and
            customisations.... like my Englis ðŸ¤£ and I would love to hear crtics
            on that ....Lastly why you are special, is obviously because I love
            talking to you, I love listening to you, I love ... ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤©ðŸ¥° "
