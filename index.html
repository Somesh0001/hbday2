          I wish whole heartedly to this amazing person whose knows how to live
          the life to the fullest and can bring smile to everyone around
          her.  ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤© "....you say that your friends doubt when you tell about me
          that if i perform well then why do i talk to you so long ðŸ¤”... Now how
          do i tell them that it is after talking to you only i get so motivated
          that i do things that i myself formerly feel unwilling to do ....."</p>
          <p>
          "I
          never felt special for anyone but you were different ....... now you
          say to feel that for others as well but sadly that's not possible
          .........you say that people around you say the same but why to blame
          them .... yes, you are very special.......... but
          at the same time i always want you to grow and i get excited when you
          tell about your achievements .......... that's why i don't message or
          call you frequently ". </p> 
          <p> "now you might wonder why do i regard you as
          special .... because unlike others you are very sincere, unlike others
          you are not jealous of other's success but you support them, you are
          respectful, you are not afraid to say sorry first when it's your
          fault, you are not egoist but yes i this is the best part for which i
          admire a lot ..... you have a lot of self-respect (unlike others) also
          while talking, you don't sugarcoat. You actually give me crtiques and
          that i like because i want to become better .....like this webpage
          still can have a lots and lots of improvements and customisations.... like my Englis ðŸ¤£ and i would love to hear crtics on it ....Lastly why you are special,
          is obviously because i love talking to you, i love listening to you, I
          love ... ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤©ðŸ¥° "
